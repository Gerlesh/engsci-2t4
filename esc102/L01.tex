        How does PIAA affect positionality?
    \end{idea}
    Some ideas from classmates:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perception sets initial opinion
        \item You interpret things based on your positionWhat or what you don't perceive affects your positionality.
        \item In breaking the action of perceive-act, you include steps that allow the time to assess your position.
        \item Filters (in perception) depend on position
        \item Understanding your position allows you to assess your interpretations
    \end{itemize}
    \item Subconcious \textbf{bias} will be brought to the table depending on your position, so others can explicityl see how \textit{you} are looking at a situation.
