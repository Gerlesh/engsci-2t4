\section{Lecture 13: Truss Analysis: Method of Joints, Method of Sections}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Method of sections is used to calculate the stresses in a group of members while the method of joints is used to calculate the stresses in every member in the truss.
    \item To use the method of joints, label all joints and do a force balance on each one.
    \item For the method of sections, cut through the truss and calculate the forces that pass through that cut.
\end{itemize}
