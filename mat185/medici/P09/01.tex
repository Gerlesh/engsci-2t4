    The wording is a bit unclear. If it implies that we first multiply row $5$ by six, and then add row $7$ to it, then the answer is no. Let $\bff{A'}$ be the resulting matrix when we multiply row $5$ by six. Then by the multilinearity principle, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        \det \bff{A'} = 5 \det \bff{A}
    \end{equation}
    Adding combinations of other rows do not impact the determinant, since:
    \begin{equation}
        \det \bff{E}(\lambda;i,j) = 1
    \end{equation}
