\section{Circuit Elements}
\subsection*{Independent sources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An ideal voltage source has zero internal resistance and can supply unlimited amounts of current to the load.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item However, in practice, voltage sources have a finite internal resistance and the current supplied to the load varies with the load.
    \end{itemize}
    \item An ideal current source has an infinite internal resistance and can have any voltage across it.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In practice, they have finite resistance and the current supplied to the load varies with the load.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Dependent sources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We discuss ways to model the behaviour of some circuit elements (e.g. amplifier). There are four different types of dependent sources:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Voltage controlled voltage source
        \item Current controlled voltage source
        \item Voltage controlled current source
        \item Current cnotrolled current source
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
